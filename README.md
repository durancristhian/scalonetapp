## How to run this project locally

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## My notes

Create an empty sqlite db by executing:

```bash
sqlite3 scalonetapp.db "VACUUM;"`
```
